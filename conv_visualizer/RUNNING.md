Highly recommend running on Windows native rather than trying to run in WSL. 
MacOS setup likely similar, but I do not have the OS running to verify.

1) Download and install Processing from https://processing.org/download

1) Open both `./visualizer/visualizer.pde` and `./drawing/drawing.pde` at the same time (opening with Processing)

1) Click `Sketch > Import Library > Manage Libraries`, and then install `PeasyCam` and `OscP5`

1) Run `./visualizer/visualizer.pde`, THEN `./drawing/drawing.pde`
